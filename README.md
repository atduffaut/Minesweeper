# Minesweeper game, yes, just like the classic one. This is an SFML based project using C++. It works when SFML is configured in Visual Studio.
However, I have not tested in any other environment. This might cause some errors in VS Code for example.
Besides that, running the SFML_Project_03.cpp file (which is the main file) will bring up the minesweeper board and offer several different game options.
Exiting is easy just close the window
